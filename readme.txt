This integrates the Affiliates plugins with the WP e-Commerce shopping cart.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates [Affiliates](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates/), [Affiliates Pro](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates-pro/) and [Affiliates Enterprise](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates-enterprise/) with [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-e-commerce).

With this integration plugin, referrals are created automatically for your affiliates when sales are made.

The plugin allows you to set a referral (commission) rate so that your affiliates get credited with a referral based on a percentage of each sale's total net amount.

Requirements:

- [Affiliates](http://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates), [Affiliates Pro](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates-pro/) or [Affiliates Enterprise](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates-enterprise/)
- [Affiliates WP e-Commerce Integration](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates-wp-e-commerce) (this plugin)
- [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce)

Install these, set up your shop, decide how much you want to pay your affiliates and start selling!

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-e-commerce) plugin. Configure your shop and create products.
2. Install and activate the [Affiliates](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/affiliates) plugin. Use the default settings or configure it to your needs.
3. Install and activate the [Affiliates WP e-Commerce Integration](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates-wp-e-commerce) plugin.
4. A new *WP e-Commerce* menu item will appear under the *Affiliates* menu in WordPress. Set the referral rate for your affiliates there.

Note that you can install the plugins from your WordPress installation directly: use the *Add new* option found in the *Plugins* menu.
You can also upload and extract them in your site's `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the *Upload* option.

If you upgrade from *Affiliates* to *Affiliates Pro* or *Affiliates Enterprise*, the default referral rate should be set automatically under *Affiliates > Settings*.
Although this is done automatically, it is adviced to double-check that the settings have been adjusted correctly.
